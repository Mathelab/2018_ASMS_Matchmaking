# “Matchmaking session: Bridging the gap between computational biology and biology” at ASMS 2018 in San Diego.

The idea is to foster communication between bench scientists (chemists and biologists) and computational biologists, and to identify areas of needs for and how these needs can be met.  The format of the session will allow for small discussion groups in hopes that these interactions will lead to future conversations and possibly collaborations. Topics will include integration of metabolomics data with other omics, metabolite pathway enrichment analysis, and integration of metabolomics data from different platforms.  This is a very interactive session and if you have a topic you’d like to introduce, let us know.
